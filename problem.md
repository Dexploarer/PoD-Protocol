# Platform Testing Report

This document summarizes issues encountered when attempting to use and test the PoD Protocol repository. It also includes suggestions for potential improvements.

## Observed Issues and Bugs

1. **Test execution fails**
   - Running `bun test` causes multiple errors due to missing `ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL` and `ANCHOR_WALLET` environment variables. Network connections to `api.devnet.solana.com` are also blocked, leading to repeated websocket failures.
   - Native module `node_datachannel.node` cannot be found, causing the CLI tests to fail.
2. **Yarn configuration problem**
   - `yarn run` commands abort with `Unrecognized or legacy configuration settings found: networkTimeout` from `.yarnrc.yml`.
3. **Build process fails**
   - `bun run build` reports `anchor-cli` version mismatch and missing `cargo build-sbf`. It also fails to resolve Rust dependency `zeroize` for the Solana program and cannot find the `rollup` command.
4. **CLI runtime error**
   - Running `node cli/dist/index.js --help` fails with `Cannot find module '../build/Release/node_datachannel.node'`.

## Enhancement Suggestions

- Provide a sample `.env` with default values for `ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL` and `ANCHOR_WALLET` to simplify local test setup.
- Remove or update the deprecated `networkTimeout` option in `.yarnrc.yml` so Yarn commands run without manual changes.
- Document installation steps for `anchor-cli`, Rust toolchain, and `rollup` so the build script can succeed in fresh environments.
- Include prebuilt native binaries or detailed instructions for building `node-datachannel` to prevent runtime errors in the CLI.
