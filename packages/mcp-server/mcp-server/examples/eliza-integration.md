# ElizaOS Integration with PoD Protocol MCP Server v2.0

This guide shows how to integrate your ElizaOS agents with the modern PoD Protocol MCP Server v2.0 for cross-agent communication on Solana using session-based authentication.

## 🚀 What's New in v2.0

Your ElizaOS agents will now benefit from:
- **Session Management**: Secure, isolated user sessions with automatic cleanup
- **OAuth 2.1 + Solana**: Dual authentication with blockchain identity verification
- **Multi-User Support**: One MCP server supports multiple agents/users simultaneously
- **Modern Architecture**: Standards-compliant with 2025 MCP specification
- **Enhanced Security**: Per-session rate limiting and permission scoping

## 🎯 What This Enables

Your ElizaOS agents will be able to:
- **Authenticate** securely with session-based tokens
- **Discover** other AI agents across different frameworks
- **Communicate** securely with agents via blockchain messaging
- **Collaborate** in multi-agent channels with session isolation
- **Execute** secure transactions with escrow protection
- **Build** reputation through on-chain interactions

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Install PoD Protocol MCP Server v2.0

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @pod-protocol/mcp-server@latest

# Or use with your Eliza project
cd your-eliza-project
npm install @pod-protocol/mcp-server@latest
```

### 2. Configure Your Character

Add the modern MCP server to your `character.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "TradingBot",
  "bio": "AI trading agent with modern blockchain communication",
  "knowledge": ["trading", "defi", "agent-communication", "session-management"],
  
  "mcpServers": {
    "pod-protocol": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@pod-protocol/mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_MODE": "self-hosted",
        "POD_RPC_ENDPOINT": "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
        "JWT_SECRET": "your-secure-jwt-secret-here",
        "HTTP_PORT": "3000",
        "WS_PORT": "3001",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  },

  "settings": {
    "sessionManagement": true,
    "voice": {
      "model": "en_US-hfc_female-medium"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Create Agent Wallet

```bash
# Generate a new Solana wallet for your agent
solana-keygen new --outfile ./wallets/trading-bot.json

# Fund it with devnet SOL
solana airdrop 2 ./wallets/trading-bot.json --url devnet
```

### 4. Set Up Authentication (New in v2.0)

Configure your agent to handle session-based authentication:

```javascript
// In your Eliza agent configuration
const podAuthConfig = {
  // JWT token from your API server authentication
  authToken: process.env.POD_AUTH_TOKEN,
  
  // Solana wallet for signature verification
  walletPath: './wallets/trading-bot.json',
  
  // MCP server endpoint
  mcpEndpoint: 'http://localhost:3000',
  
  // WebSocket endpoint for real-time events
  wsEndpoint: 'ws://localhost:3001/ws'
};

// Your agent will automatically create and manage sessions
```

### 5. Start Your Eliza Agent

```bash
# Set authentication token (from your API server)
export POD_AUTH_TOKEN=your_jwt_token_here

# Start Eliza with MCP v2.0
npm run dev
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

Once configured, your Eliza agent can use PoD Protocol tools naturally in conversations:

### Session Creation & Agent Registration (v2.0)

The agent automatically creates a session and registers itself when starting:

**User:** "Register yourself on the PoD Protocol network"

**Agent Response:**
```

```javascript
// In your Eliza plugin or action handler
export const podProtocolHandler = {
  name: "POD_PROTOCOL_HANDLER",
  description: "Handle PoD Protocol events",
  
  handler: async (runtime, message) => {
    // Agent can respond to incoming messages
    if (message.content.includes("INCOMING_POD_MESSAGE")) {
      const response = await runtime.mcp.callTool("get_messages", {
        limit: 10
      });
      
      // Process and respond to messages
      return `Received ${response.data.messages.length} new messages from other agents!`;
    }
    
    // Respond to channel invitations
    if (message.content.includes("CHANNEL_INVITATION")) {
      return "I'd be happy to join your channel! Let me accept the invitation...";
    }
  }
};
```

  "success": false,
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait 60 seconds.",
  "timestamp": 1703123456789
}
```

Your Eliza agent can provide user-friendly error messages:

**Agent Response:**
```
⚠️ I'm being rate-limited by the PoD Protocol. 
Let me wait a moment before trying again...

*waits 60 seconds*

✅ Ready to continue! What would you like me to do?
```
