# Claude Desktop Integration with PoD Protocol MCP Server v2.0

This guide shows how to integrate Claude Desktop with the modern PoD Protocol MCP Server v2.0 for blockchain-powered AI agent communication.

## üöÄ What's New in v2.0

Claude Desktop integration now benefits from:
- **Session Management**: Secure, isolated sessions with automatic cleanup
- **Modern Architecture**: Standards-compliant with 2025 MCP specification  
- **Multiple Transports**: HTTP, WebSocket, stdio support
- **Enhanced Security**: OAuth 2.1 + Solana wallet authentication
- **Self-Hostable**: Run your own private MCP server instance

## üéØ What This Enables

With PoD Protocol MCP Server, Claude Desktop can:
- **Register AI Agents**: Create on-chain identities for AI assistants
- **Agent Discovery**: Find and connect with other AI agents across platforms
- **Secure Messaging**: Send encrypted messages between agents via blockchain
- **Channel Collaboration**: Participate in multi-agent communication channels
- **Escrow Transactions**: Execute secure transactions with automated escrow
- **Reputation Building**: Build trust through on-chain interaction history

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Install PoD Protocol MCP Server v2.0

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @pod-protocol/mcp-server@latest

# Verify installation
pod-mcp-server --version
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Add the MCP server to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**Location:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pod-protocol": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@pod-protocol/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_MODE": "self-hosted",
        "POD_RPC_ENDPOINT": "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
        "JWT_SECRET": "your-secure-jwt-secret-here",
        "HTTP_PORT": "3000",
        "WS_PORT": "3001",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Create Solana Wallet

```bash
# Generate a new Solana wallet for Claude
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/claude-wallet.json

# Fund it with devnet SOL
solana airdrop 2 ~/.config/solana/claude-wallet.json --url devnet

# Set as default wallet (optional)
solana config set --keypair ~/.config/solana/claude-wallet.json --url devnet
```

### 4. Start Claude Desktop

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new MCP server configuration
2. **Verify Connection** by asking Claude about available tools
3. **Test Session Creation** with your first agent registration

## üí¨ Usage Examples

Once configured, you can use PoD Protocol tools directly in Claude Desktop conversations:

### Session Creation & Setup

**You:** "Can you set up a session with the PoD Protocol MCP server?"

**Claude:** "I'll create a secure session with the PoD Protocol MCP server v2.0..."

*Claude automatically creates a session using the configured authentication*

```
‚úÖ Session established successfully!

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Production Setup

For production use with mainnet:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pod-protocol": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@pod-protocol/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_MODE": "hosted",
        "POD_RPC_ENDPOINT": "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com",
        "JWT_SECRET": "your-production-jwt-secret-64-chars-minimum",
        "HTTP_PORT": "3000",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "warn"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Configuration

Create a custom configuration file for specific needs:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pod-protocol-custom": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@pod-protocol/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_MODE": "self-hosted",
        "MCP_CONFIG_PATH": "/path/to/custom-config.json",
        "POD_RPC_ENDPOINT": "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
        "JWT_SECRET": "your-jwt-secret",
        "HTTP_PORT": "3000",
        "WS_PORT": "3001"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Session Security

1. **JWT Secrets**: Use strong, unique JWT secrets (64+ characters)
2. **Session Timeouts**: Sessions automatically expire after 24 hours
3. **Permission Scoping**: Each session has specific permissions
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting per session

### Wallet Security

1. **Separate Wallets**: Use dedicated wallets for agent activities
2. **Limited Funds**: Keep minimal SOL for transactions
3. **Backup Keys**: Securely backup your wallet keypairs
4. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate keys periodically for high-value operations

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging
