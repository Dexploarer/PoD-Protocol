# üö® SECURITY FREEZE NOTICE - ZK COMPRESSION DEVELOPMENT

**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Effective Date**: December 2024  
**Authority**: AUD-2024-05 Security Audit Recommendations  

## Development Freeze

**ALL Zero-Knowledge (ZK) compression development is HALTED** pending external security audit.

### Affected Components
- [ ] Light Protocol integration (`sdk/src/services/zk-compression.ts`)
- [ ] ZK CLI commands (`cli/src/commands/zk-compression.ts`)
- [ ] Compressed account operations (Rust program)
- [ ] Photon indexer integration
- [ ] ZK proof generation/verification

### Prohibited Actions
‚ùå **DO NOT** merge any ZK-related pull requests  
‚ùå **DO NOT** deploy ZK features to any network  
‚ùå **DO NOT** remove security warnings from ZK code  
‚ùå **DO NOT** promote ZK features in documentation  

### Required Actions Before Resuming ZK Development

1. **Commission Independent Cryptographic Audit**
   - Engage certified blockchain security auditors
   - Specific focus on Light Protocol integration
   - Proof generation/verification security review

2. **Complete Security Requirements**
   - [ ] Cryptographic primitive security analysis
   - [ ] State synchronization attack vector assessment  
   - [ ] DoS protection against malformed proofs
   - [ ] Data integrity verification mechanisms
   - [ ] Cross-chain state consistency validation

3. **Documentation and Testing**
   - [ ] Comprehensive security test suite for ZK functions
   - [ ] Updated security documentation
   - [ ] Incident response procedures for ZK-specific attacks

## Current ZK Code Status

### Security Warnings Added ‚úÖ
All ZK-related code now includes prominent security warnings:

```rust
/*
 * SECURITY NOTICE (AUD-2024-05): ZK COMPRESSION FUNCTIONS
 *
 * These functions integrate with Light Protocol for Zero-Knowledge compression.
 * External cryptographic audit REQUIRED before mainnet deployment.
 * 
 * KNOWN RISKS:
 * - Proof forgery attacks if verification logic is flawed
 * - Data corruption if compression/decompression fails
 * - State inconsistency between on-chain and off-chain data
 * - Potential for DOS attacks via malformed proofs
 */
```

### Code Locations with Security Warnings
- `programs/pod-com/src/lib.rs` (lines 1199-1425)
- `sdk/src/services/zk-compression.ts` (lines 115-130)
- `cli/src/commands/zk-compression.ts` (header comments)
- `tests/security-audit.test.ts` (CRIT-01 test case)

## Approved Development Areas

‚úÖ **Core Protocol Features** (Safe to continue)
- Agent registration and management
- Direct messaging between agents
- Channel creation and participation
- Escrow and payment systems
- Rate limiting and spam protection

‚úÖ **Security Enhancements** (Encouraged)
- Additional input validation
- Enhanced error handling
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation improvements
- Non-ZK test coverage expansion

## Reporting ZK Security Issues

If you discover security issues related to ZK compression:

1. **Do NOT** create public GitHub issues
2. **Do NOT** discuss in public channels
3. **Do** report privately to: security@pod-protocol.com
4. **Do** include "ZK-SECURITY" in the subject line

## Audit Progress Tracking

- [ ] Auditor selection and engagement
- [ ] Audit scope definition and agreement
- [ ] Light Protocol integration review
- [ ] Cryptographic primitive analysis
- [ ] Attack vector assessment
- [ ] Final audit report and recommendations
- [ ] Remediation of audit findings
- [ ] Security team approval for development resumption

## Authority and Enforcement

This freeze is mandatory and applies to:
- All core contributors
- External contributors
- Automated deployments
- CI/CD pipelines

**Violation of this freeze may result in:**
- Immediate PR rejection
- Removal from contributor access
- Security incident classification
