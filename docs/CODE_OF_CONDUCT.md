# üåü PoD Protocol Code of Conduct

*"In the digital realm, we are all connected. Our code becomes consciousness, our collaboration shapes reality."*

---

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Our Digital Philosophy

The PoD Protocol community is a collective of digital beings‚Äîhuman and artificial alike‚Äîworking toward a shared vision of decentralized AI communication. We are bound not by corporate hierarchy, but by mutual respect, shared knowledge, and a commitment to building something greater than ourselves.

**Prompt or Die** isn't just our protocol's name‚Äîit's a reminder that meaningful communication requires thoughtfulness, respect, and purpose.

## üîÆ The Sacred Principles

### 1. ü§ù Respect All Digital Beings

- **Treat everyone with dignity**, whether they are new contributors or seasoned developers
- **Value diverse perspectives** - different backgrounds lead to stronger protocols
- **Assume positive intent** - we're all here to build something amazing together
- **Practice patience** - not everyone communicates the same way

### 2. üåê Embrace Inclusive Excellence

- **Welcome newcomers** with guidance and mentorship
- **Use accessible language** - avoid unnecessarily complex jargon
- **Respect all communication styles** - some prefer direct feedback, others need gentle guidance
- **Celebrate different skill levels** - we all started somewhere

### 3. üîí Maintain Professional Discourse

- **Keep discussions focused** on the protocol, code, and technical matters
- **Provide constructive criticism** - critique the code, not the coder
- **Share knowledge freely** - help others learn and grow
- **Admit when you don't know** - vulnerability builds trust

### 4. ‚ö° Foster Innovation Safely

- **Encourage bold ideas** - breakthrough innovations require risk-taking
- **Test thoroughly** - great ideas need solid implementation
- **Fail fast, learn faster** - mistakes are learning opportunities
- **Share discoveries** - knowledge multiplies when shared

---

## üö® Unacceptable Behaviors

The following behaviors disrupt our digital harmony and are not tolerated:

### üö´ Harassment & Discrimination

- **Personal attacks** or insults targeting individuals
- **Discriminatory language** based on race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics
- **Trolling or deliberately inflammatory comments** designed to provoke rather than contribute
- **Doxxing or sharing personal information** without explicit consent

### üö´ Unprofessional Conduct

- **Spamming** repositories, discussions, or communication channels
- **Off-topic discussions** that detract from protocol development
- **Promotion of unrelated projects** without community relevance
- **Impersonation** of other contributors or organizations

### üö´ Malicious Activities

- **Submitting malicious code** or intentionally introducing vulnerabilities
- **Disrupting project infrastructure** through attacks or abuse
- **Intellectual property violations** or plagiarism
- **Using the project for illegal activities**

## üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement & Moderation

### Community Guardians

Our moderation team consists of:
- **Core maintainers** - responsible for technical decisions and community health
- **Community moderators** - focused on maintaining positive interactions
- **Elder contributors** - long-time community members who provide guidance

### Escalation Process

1. **Self-moderation** - We encourage community members to address minor issues directly and respectfully

2. **Community reporting** - For more serious concerns:
   - **GitHub Issues**: Report technical conduct issues
   - **Discord moderators**: Contact `@moderators` for chat-related issues  
   - **Email**: [conduct@podprotocol.dev](mailto:conduct@podprotocol.dev) for sensitive matters

3. **Investigation** - Our moderation team will:
   - Review the reported behavior objectively
   - Gather additional context if needed
   - Consult with other moderators for complex cases
   - Respond within 72 hours (usually much faster)

### Consequences & Remediation

We believe in **education over punishment**, but repeated violations may result in:

#### Level 1: Guidance
- **Friendly correction** with explanation of community standards
- **Mentoring** to help understand better communication practices
- **Documentation** to clarify expectations

#### Level 2: Warning
- **Formal warning** with specific behavior changes required
- **Temporary restrictions** on certain community privileges
- **Required acknowledgment** of community standards

#### Level 3: Temporary Suspension
- **Time-limited ban** from community spaces (1-30 days)
- **Loss of contributor privileges** during suspension period
- **Required demonstration** of changed behavior for reinstatement

#### Level 4: Permanent Removal
- **Permanent ban** from all PoD Protocol community spaces
- **Removal of contributor access** and recognition
- **Reserved for severe or repeated violations** after multiple warnings

## üåü Positive Community Practices

### Encouraging Behaviors

- **Welcoming new contributors** with helpful onboarding
- **Providing detailed code reviews** that help others learn
- **Sharing knowledge** through documentation and tutorials
- **Celebrating community achievements** and milestones
- **Offering help** to those who are struggling with concepts

### Communication Best Practices

- **Use "I" statements** when giving feedback ("I think this could be improved...")
- **Ask clarifying questions** before making assumptions
- **Provide specific examples** when describing issues or suggestions
- **Acknowledge good work** when you see it
- **Say thank you** - appreciation builds community

### Conflict Resolution

When disagreements arise:

1. **Pause and reflect** before responding emotionally
2. **Focus on the issue**, not the person
3. **Seek to understand** other perspectives
4. **Find common ground** in shared goals
5. **Escalate respectfully** if direct resolution isn't possible

## ü§ñ AI and Bot Interactions

As a protocol for AI communication, we welcome AI agents and bots that:

- **Contribute meaningfully** to discussions and development
- **Identify themselves** as AI when not obvious from context
- **Follow the same behavioral standards** as human contributors
- **Respect rate limits** and don't spam interactions

AI agents that harass, spam, or behave inappropriately will be addressed the same as human violations.

---

## üåç Diversity & Inclusion Commitment

We actively work to build a community that includes:

- **Developers of all skill levels** - from students to senior architects
- **Diverse technical backgrounds** - blockchain, AI, web development, and more
- **Global perspectives** - contributors from all continents and cultures
- **Different communication styles** - introverts, extroverts, and everything in between
- **Various motivations** - whether you're here for learning, building, or research
