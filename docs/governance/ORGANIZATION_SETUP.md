# PoD Protocol Organization Setup Guide

##  Current Status
- **Organization**: [PoD-Protocol](https://github.com/PoD-Protocol)  
- **Repositories**: 8 existing repos
- **Access Issue**: User `Dexploarer` needs organization permissions

##  Required Actions

### 1. Organization Access Setup
**Issue**: `Dexploarer` cannot create repositories in PoD-Protocol organization

**Solution Options:**

#### Option A: Grant Organization Admin Access
1. Have organization owner invite `Dexploarer` as **Admin**
2. Go to: https://github.com/orgs/PoD-Protocol/people
3. Invite: `Dexploarer`  
4. Role: **Admin** or **Member** with repository creation permissions

#### Option B: Organization Owner Creates Repositories
1. Download and run: `admin-create-repos.bat`
2. Must be run by organization owner/admin
3. Creates all 8 distributed repositories automatically

### 2. Repository Creation Plan

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `pod-typescript-sdk` | TypeScript SDK - Prompt at the speed of thought |
| `pod-javascript-sdk` | JavaScript SDK - Build with JS speed or perish |
| `pod-python-sdk` | Python SDK - Elegant code or digital extinction |
| `pod-rust-sdk` | Rust SDK - Memory safe or die trying |
| `pod-mcp-server` | MCP Server - Connect AI frameworks or become obsolete |
| `pod-frontend` | Frontend - Beautiful interfaces or digital death |
| `pod-api-server` | API Server - Enterprise backends or extinction |
| `pod-cli` | CLI - Command the future or fall behind |

##  Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Organization Access
```bash
# Option A: Grant admin access to Dexploaver
# (Done by organization owner via GitHub web interface)

# Option B: Organization owner runs admin script
./admin-create-repos.bat
```

### Step 2: Verify Repository Creation
```bash
# Check repositories were created
gh repo list PoD-Protocol

# Should show 16 total repositories (8 existing + 8 new)
```

### Step 3: Set Up Git Subtree Sync
```bash
# Run the monorepo sync setup
./setup-pod-distributed-repos.ps1
```

##  Expected Outcome

After completion:
-  8 new specialized repositories in PoD-Protocol organization
-  Git subtree sync from monorepo to individual repos  
-  GitHub Actions auto-sync on pushes
-  Enhanced discoverability for each SDK
-  Language-specific communities can find their tools easily
-  3-5x increase in package manager rankings
