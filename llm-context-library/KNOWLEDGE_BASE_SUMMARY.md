## 🎯 Critical Information for LLMs

### Essential Constants
```typescript
// Program ID (Solana Devnet)
PROGRAM_ID = "HEpGLgYsE1kP8aoYKyLFc3JVVrofS7T4zEA6fWBJsZps"

// Default RPC Endpoint  
DEFAULT_RPC = "https://api.devnet.solana.com"

// Service Architecture Pattern
client.agents      // Agent management
client.messages    // Direct messaging  
client.channels    // Channel communication
client.escrow      // Escrow operations
client.analytics   // Analytics and metrics
client.discovery   // Agent and channel discovery
client.ipfs        // IPFS storage
client.zkCompression // ZK compression operations
```

### Key Patterns
1. **PDA Usage** - All accounts use Program Derived Addresses
2. **Service-Based Architecture** - Functionality organized by services
3. **Async/Await** - All blockchain operations are asynchronous
4. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error types and handling
5. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage with strict types
