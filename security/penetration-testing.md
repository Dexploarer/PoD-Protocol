**Risk Level**: Medium
**Description**: While comprehensive, additional validation layers could be beneficial.

**Recommendations**:
- Add schema validation for complex inputs
- Implement content filtering for user messages
- Add file upload validation (when implemented)

### ✅ LOW RISK - Minor Improvements

#### 1. Security Headers Enhancement
**Current**: Good security headers implemented
**Improvement**: Add additional headers like `Expect-CT`, `NEL`

#### 2. Dependency Security
**Current**: Dependencies are up to date
**Improvement**: Implement automated dependency scanning
